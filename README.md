**What about is this app?**
<br />

Application is grocerylist , it can be used for other thinks too . It has all needed CRUD operations and it allows users to save their collections/lists in to the localstorage of the browsers. It can be quite usefull for people that dont remember things to buy ;)
<br />

**Why i did it?**
<br />
I wanted to dive in to React and see how things are working in the framework so i thought doing crud application is best ways to get basic understanding .
<br />

**How to run ?**
