**What about is this app?**

Application is grocerylist , it can be used for other thinks too . It has all needed CRUD operations and it allows users to save their collections/lists in to the localstorage of the browsers. It can be quite usefull for people that dont remember things to buy ;)

**Why i did it?**
I wanted to dive in to React and see how things are working in the framework so i thought doing crud application is best ways to get basic understanding .

**How to run ?**
pull and just npm start form the terminal.

**Live preview?**
